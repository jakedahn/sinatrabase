This is the structure I use for developing all of my database-driven applications using Sinatra. Please feel free to use it however you would like. If you have any suggestions or fixes please email me: jake@ang.st

If you would not like to use a database, but would still like some structure - just delete the 'db' directory, 'Rakefile', and the 'models.rb' file.
